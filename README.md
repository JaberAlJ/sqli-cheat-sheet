## What this repository contains

The repo is organized to mirror how many security learning resources (e.g. PortSwigger) present SQLi concepts: from fundamentals to detection, exploitation, and advanced techniques, with platform-specific examples and tool guidance.

Top-level folders and purpose:

* [Basics](Cheat%20Sheets/Basics/README.md) — Introduces SQLi, common SQL syntax and statements you should know.
* [Detection](Cheat%20Sheets/Detection/README.md) — Safe detection methods: error-message analysis, response analysis, and techniques for recognizing blind SQLi.

Each folder contains a `README.md` explaining its scope and linking to the files inside.

---

## Who this is for

* Developers who want to understand how SQLi works so they can fix it.
* Security students and beginners learning web application security concepts.
* Penetration testers who need a compact reference of techniques and payloads.
