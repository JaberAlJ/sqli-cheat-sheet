# Exploitation — Overview & Guidance

This folder explains common SQL Injection exploitation techniques and when they apply. The content focuses on **how attacks work**, **safe testing approaches**, and **defensive guidance**. Always operate within legal and ethical boundaries.

## Files in this folder

* [union-based.md](union-based.md) — Combine attacker-controlled SELECTs with application output (requires same columns/types). UNION SELECT attacks and column-count/type mapping.
* [error-based.md](error-based.md) — Induce DB errors to leak information in error messages. Forcing DB errors that reveal data.
* [boolean-based.md](boolean-based.md) — Infer data via differences in application responses for true/false conditions. Blind boolean SQLi extraction techniques.
* [time-based.md](time-based.md) — Infer data via DB-induced delays when conditions are true. Blind time-based extraction using `SLEEP`/`pg_sleep`/`WAITFOR`.
* [stacked-queries.md](stacked-queries.md) — Multiple statements executed in a single request (very dangerous). Piggybacked multiple-statement attacks and their dangers.

## Recommended reading order

1. [union-based.md](union-based.md)
2. [error-based.md](error-based.md)
3. [boolean-based.md](boolean-based.md)
4. [time-based.md](time-based.md)
5. [stacked-queries.md](stacked-queries.md)

## How to use these pages

* Use `union-based.md` and `error-based.md` only when the application returns query output or verbose errors.
* Use `boolean-based.md` or `time-based.md` in blind scenarios where no direct output is available.
* Always prefer safe, non-destructive probes and stay within scope.

## Defensive checklist for exploitation vectors

* Parameterize queries—this is the most effective defense.
* Enforce least privilege for DB accounts and restrict dangerous DB functions.
* Hide verbose errors and normalize responses to limit information leakage.
* Monitor logs for unusual query shapes, rapid probing, or many similar requests.
